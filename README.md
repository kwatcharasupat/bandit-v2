# Bandit Model (Re)implementation

Bandit model (re)implementation as seen in "Remastering Divide and Remaster: A Cinematic Audio Source Separation Dataset with Multilingual Support" by Karn N. Watcharasupat, Chih-Wei Wu, and Iroro Orife. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07275).

Model weights are available on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/records/12701995).

PS: I'm hoping to get this repo to eventually unify all [Bandit-based models](https://github.com/kwatcharasupat/source-separation-landing), but research code gets refactored incompatibly a lot so let's see where this goes.
